							<h2>The Basics of Generative Music</h2>

							<p>
							The term generative music describes music that is created by a system, often algorithms. In my particular case, I used different algorithms to generate music based on a specific piece.
							The different approaches to generative music can be categorized accordingly to their ability to generate musical pieces. The musicality of the algorithm, therefore, depends on its ability to follow musical short-term rules as well as larger spans of musical development. </p>

							<p>
							If a model lacks the ability to create musical long-term structures, the generated composition might sound like it is “noodling”; the lack of overall coherence. However, long-term structures require a bunch of other musical requirements to work reliably before they can express their effect. In most of my generative approaches, I trained my model with a song that I sought to imitate with a generated composition. A model imitated a song well when it took up musical motifs from the original song as well as short melody progressions that were distinct for the training song. Most models did naturally pick up the harmonics correctly when subtle or no key changes took place.</p> 

							<p>
							To make all models musically sound, all models considered the three out of  four main properties of musical sounds:</p>

							<ul>

							<li>Pitch</li>
							<li>Dynamics</li>
							<li>Duration</li>
							<li><strike>Tone Color</strike></li>

							</ul>
							<p>
							While tone color is an essential part of musical sounds, I limited my project to the generation of MIDI-files which are loosely the digital equivalent to written score. The tone color (or instrument choice) is in the hands of the interpret. The synthesis of instrument sounds is another area that is heavily being explored through new machine learning technologies. Check out the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/magenta/gansynth/gansynth_demo.ipynb" target="_blank">GANSynth Google Colab instrument synthesis notebook</a>. 
							</p>
							<h2>Different Approaches</h2>
							<p>
							The following machine learning approaches explore the different capabilities of current generative music attempts. For my first attempt, Markov chains, I used the visual programming software Max/MSP, which is commonly used for music and media development. For the more complex models, I made use of complex pre-trained models long short-term memory-based (LSTM) recurrent neuronal networks and attention-based neuronal networks.
							</p>
							<h3>Markov Chains</h3>
							<p>
								Markov chains are good at finding motifs and small recognizable musical patterns. However, they lack the ability to create long-term structures. When they create them, they create them in an inconsistent, not necessarily musically logical pattern.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the original MIDI-song that I used for training the Markov chain. Please note that this is a recording of a MIDI-file that is played on a virtual keyboard.</br></br>
