**Dear People Power People**,Â 

When I try to choose words most resonant with my multi-layered existence, I seek to say that I am a trans-disciplinary boundary-spanner, able to navigate complexity ranging from bureaucratic to social, organizational, and technical. Recently, Iâ€™ve focused on organizing Offers and Needs Markets in the East Bay and working as the secretary for the network called *Engineering, Social Justice, and Peace*, centering decolonization of land and people - instead of technological problem-solving. 

You described yourself as technology agnostic. Wonderful way to put it! Related to this, the co-op model is my preferred governance structure and part of my theory of change.

>I am aware that my background as a white, German-born engineering-educated being holds systemic privilege and conditioning, which I constantly reflect on. You have good reasons to not trust me without needed time to build trust. I see the exploration of this dynamic as essential in my work with you and desire the continued intentional transformation of internal & external power relations. Let me know if you want to engage around this topic before moving forward. 
>
>I take intentional steps to embody the values **health, cooperation, care, and consent** and feel such a strong pull to your work because you emanate these frequencies back to me. 

On a more technical level, my experience spans managing and installing solar system upgrades, building sun trackers, wind turbine siting studies, and environmental research. However, Iâ€™ve found just as much value in the communication side of things, such as developing community-owned maintenance manuals and facilitating spaces for dialogue and collaboration. Iâ€™m passionate about growing as a communicator, facilitator, and space holder, and I consider these skills integral to my work.

Iâ€™m a self-starter with a strong ambition to interweave efforts as they align with larger goals. Many of the projects Iâ€™ve been involved in, whether it was constructing a tiny house using natural materials or co-founding a **self-governed permaculture off-the-grid program** for engineering students, were initiatives I nurtured through grant-writing and fundraising and grew from seed - rather than projects I was assigned to.

People often tell me they appreciate my ability to build caring relationships. I have a strong drive to optimize organizational workflows and have developed information management tools for large research projects in the past.

>I am ready to pour my heart into the OakTREE project! I might be a little younger than most project managers, but I promise that I am a dedicated fit for this flexibility-demanding position. We can also work together for a few weeks and see how it feels! I will be the first one to admit a misalignment. 

Iâ€™m eager to offer my blend of management, technical expertise, communication, creative flow optimization, and country-centered work to People Power Solar Cooperative, where I see the strongest alignment out all my job applications since graduation in May.

Warmly, 

Leon ðŸŒ»
