**Dear People Power People**,Â 

When I try to choose words most resonant with my multi-layered existence, I seek to say that I am a multidisciplinary boundary-spanner, able to navigate complex projects from bureaucratic to social, repetitive, and technical. Recently, Iâ€™ve focused on organizing Offers and Needs Markets in the East Bay and working as the secretary for the network called *Engineering, Social Justice, and Peace*, centering decolonization of land and people - instead  of technological problem-solving. You said technology agnostic. Wonderful way to put it. Related to this, the co-op model is my preferred governance structure and part of my theory of change.

>I take intentional steps to embody the values **health, cooperation, care, and consent** and feel such a strong pull to your work because you emanate these frequencies back to me.

On a more technical level level, my experience spans managing and installing solar system upgrades, building sun trackers, wind turbine siting studies, and environmental research. However, Iâ€™ve found just as much value in the communication side of things, such as developing community-owned maintenance manuals and facilitating spaces for dialogue and collaboration. Iâ€™m passionate about growing as a communicator, facilitator, and space holder, and I consider these skills integral to my work.

Iâ€™m a self-starter with a strong ambition to interweave efforts as they align with larger goals. Many of the projects Iâ€™ve been involved in, whether it was constructing a tiny house using natural materials or starting a permaculture off-the-grid program for engineering students, were initiatives I nurtured and grew from seed rather than assignments I was given.

People often tell me they appreciate my ability to build caring relationships. I have a strong drive to optimize organizational workflows and have developed information management tools for large research projects in the past. 

>I am ready to pour my heart into the OakTREE project! I might be a little younger than most project managers, but I promise that I am a wonderful fit for this flexibility-demanding position. 

After working as a fish-friendly water turbine engineer & scientist, I experienced the lack of participatory action research and critical thinking. I tried to find the most radical program out there, ending up at my Masterâ€™s in Engineering, Sustainability, and Health. I honed my writing and illustration skills through weekly blog posts, videos, and illustrations which helped me become a more effective communicator. Iâ€™m eager to bring this blend of management, technical expertise, communication, and country-centered work to People Power Solar Cooperative, where I see the strongest alignment out all my job applications since graduation in May.

Warmly, 

Leon ðŸŒ»
