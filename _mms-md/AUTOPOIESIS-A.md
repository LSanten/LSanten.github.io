# The essence of our social systems is reproduced in the structures they create

The characteristic of a system to maintain itself and reproduce the conditions for its emergence is one way to define life. We give this characteristic the name Autopoiesis (translating to self-recreation). While this term was introduced by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to describe natural systems in 1972 with the title ‚ÄúAutopoiesis and Cognition - The Realization of the Living‚Äù (link [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-009-8947-4)), Niklas Luhmann transferred this theory to the social realm, showing that social systems portray characteristics of living systems as they are self-organizing and self-reproducing ([Albert 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.7)).

We can think of the essence of our social systems as the code or ontological primitives (smallest building blocks of what we consider valuable, reality, purpose, and sacred [[ONTOLOGICAL-PRIMITIVES]]).

## üìù Notes: self-referential reproduction of social systems

**From a conversation with Dhara on LinkedIn:** I resonate with your insights to reflect on the values embedded in our work. I have found that knowing the term "ontological primitives" is helpful in encapsulating the importance of "values, purpose, and the sense of the sacred" as the essence that resurfaces throughout the projects/structures we create - and especially once our projects take off on their own; gain life force. For instance, we might build a structure (app/company) with the intention of earning fruits (human connections based on creativity). The fruits bring new energy and life to the world. The new sprouts contain a seed with a similar DNA (essence = ontological primitives) from which the structure (or tree) has grown. Since the power of the seed or essence cannot always be seen at first glance in all parts of the tree, it helps to have the awareness that the essence of our work will eventually re-appear in the next structures that grow from the seeds in the new fruits.
