# Marbles in the works
## mostly.mutual.studio
This note serves as a collection board for ongoing projects, developed ideas without supportive visualizations, and undeveloped ideas. 

Feel free to explore. Since I haven't finished these projects, they hold the opportunity to collaborate. Let's see what emerges between us!

## üåü Almost ready to share or publish
- [MMSPhilOfSciA](MMSPhilOfSciA.md) - Philosophy of science and the scientific method: add Vanasupa reference, queer methodologies and clean up
- [MMSHistOfSci-A](MMSHistOfSci-A.md) - a timeline of the scientific method and its problematic roots

## üå± Concrete ideas, ready to visualize
- [MMSFinanceVisual](MMSFinanceVisual.md) - draw visual with clean vector graphics or lino cut style
- [ENERGY-ENG-A](ENERGY-ENG-A.md) - make simple graphics of quotes to post online, record key video components for online
- [[MMSAtWhoseCostVisual]]
- [[MMSHerbalismParadox]]

## üåÄ Something cool can come out of this; no concrete pieces yet
- [AGRICULTURE-A](AGRICULTURE-A.md) - visual to share relative sizes of emissions and land use
- [BOUNDARY-SPANNING](BOUNDARY-SPANNING.md) - very interesting words and concepts, maybe just make simple table
- [MILIT-A](MILIT-A.md) - dots for DOE funding compared with IRA
- [SEEDS-A](SEEDS-A.md) - a quick graphic with info on seeds using image from April 2nd 2024
- [APP-IDEA-D](APP-IDEA-D.md) - (and other app ideas) - creating interface mockup 
- interface mockup for collaborative Amazon
- ‚òÄÔ∏è a scale that weights all enslaved animals and several times the amount of mammal weight on the other side 
- [MMSSystemIntervention-A](MMSSystemIntervention-A.md) List of complex systems intervention points - Donella Meadows
- [[MMSIcebergDynamics]] Iceberg graphic from Linda Vanasupa
- [[MMSWhiteSupremacy-A]] List of white supremacy characteristics 
- [MMSAtWhoseCostVisual](MMSAtWhoseCostVisual.md)
- Graphic Design Project for simple message: Environmental Justice = Social Justice and vice versa

## ‚ú® Needs work to look nicer
- [ELECTRICITY-BOTTOM-BILLION](ELECTRICITY-BOTTOM-BILLION.md) - the colors and graphic don't look very nice; maybe make it look like a print
