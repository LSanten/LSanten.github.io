# Marbles in the works - mostly.mutual.studio
This note is supposed to help me with identifying project opportunities in moments when I want to create but don't know what to do. 

## Concrete ideas, ready to visualize
- [MMSFinanceVisual](MMSFinanceVisual.md) - draw visual with clean vector graphics or lino cut style
- [ENERGY-ENG-A](ENERGY-ENG-A.md) - make simple graphics of quotes to post online, record key video components for online

## ðŸŒŸ Almost ready to share or publish
- [ROOTS-OF-RENEWABLES](ROOTS-OF-RENEWABLES.md) - edit text and find good sources
- [MMSPhilOfSciA](MMSPhilOfSciA.md) - add Vanasupa reference, queer methodologies and clean up
- [MMSHistOfSci-A](MMSHistOfSci-A.md)

## Something cool can come out of this; no concrete pieces yet
- [AGRICULTURE-A](AGRICULTURE-A.md) - visual to share relative sizes of emissions and land use
- [BOUNDARY-SPANNING](BOUNDARY-SPANNING.md) - very interesting words and concepts, maybe just make simple table

## Needs to look nicer
- [ELECTRICITY-BOTTOM-BILLION](ELECTRICITY-BOTTOM-BILLION.md) - the colors and graphic don't look that nice; maybe make it look like a print
