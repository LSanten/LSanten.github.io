title: Our scientific innovation paradigm is based on extractive processes

# Our scientific innovation paradigm is based on extractive processes

Our scientific innovation paradigm is based on extractive processes like mining and on the industrial education system. It is also based on profit down the line. Profit means exploitation somewhere else. This system is based on free things like resources and labor. Therefore, we cannot build technology in the current system to solve the climate change "problem", because climate change is the the result of ripping earth out of the land and controlling local & indigenous people to do that for the colonizers. 

... so in the end, healing our world from climate change means to change how humans deal with the land and people on it. If locals decided how to rip the land apart, the would likely approach it with gentleness and care [[CLIMATE-CHANGE-A]].
