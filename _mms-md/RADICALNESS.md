# Radicalness means to go back to the roots of the injustice

>The concept of the “radical” inherits its most powerful meaning from the Latin word for “rooted,” in the sense that radical ideas, ideologies, or perspectives are informed by the understanding that social, political, economic, and cultural problems are outcomes of deeply rooted and systemic antagonisms, contradictions, power imbalances, and forms of oppression and exploitation. [1]

>As a result, radicalism does not so much describe a certain set of tactics, strategies, or beliefs. Rather, it speaks to a general understanding that, even if the system as a whole can be changed through gradual institutional reforms, those reforms must be based on and aimed at a transformation of the fundamental qualities and tenets of the system itself. [1]

### The roots of plants are the most intelligent part 
When I think about what it means to embody radicalness, to embody the properties of the root, I turn to roots in nature. What do they teach us? 

The tip of the root is the sensing, most intelligent part of the plant. Plant roots investigate critically and independently while staying connected to their origin. They communicate with fungi and other roots. They engage in reciprocity. 

Therefore, to me, being radical means to be a critical thinker and intentional decision maker. If roots were literate, they would probably love *critical theory*.
