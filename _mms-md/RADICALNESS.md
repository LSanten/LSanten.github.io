# Radicalness means to go back to the roots of the injustice

>The concept of the “radical” inherits its most powerful meaning from the Latin word for “rooted,” in the sense that radical ideas, ideologies, or perspectives are informed by the understanding that social, political, economic, and cultural problems are outcomes of deeply rooted and systemic antagonisms, contradictions, power imbalances, and forms of oppression and exploitation. [1]

>As a result, radicalism does not so much describe a certain set of tactics, strategies, or beliefs. Rather, it speaks to a general understanding that, even if the system as a whole can be changed through gradual institutional reforms, those reforms must be based on and aimed at a transformation of the fundamental qualities and tenets of the system itself. [1]

### The roots of plants are the most intelligent part 
Embodying radicalness, being the root, learning from the roots of plants. What do they teach us? Plant roots investigate critically and independently while staying connected to their origin. They communicate with fungi and other roots. They engage in reciprocity. 

Therefore, to me, being radical (as inspired by roots) means to be a critical thinker and intentional decision maker. If roots were literate, they would probably love *critical theory*.
