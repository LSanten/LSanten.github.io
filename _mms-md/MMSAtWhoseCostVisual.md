Visualization idea sketch: two circles - one each representing 
- a person enjoying at the cost of others 
	- arrows going inside delivering things or symbols creating pain around it but joy within the circle 
	- label: ALLOWED
- a person enjoying themselves at the cost of their own bodily health 
	- only pain within and no pain to others
	- label: PROHIBITED
	- but potentially at the cost of other oppressors to benefit from people who are not liberated
