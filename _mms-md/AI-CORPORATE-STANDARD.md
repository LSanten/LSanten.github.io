![My response: i actually think your response is super corporate baseline jargon and my company is much more attuned to a personal perspective. Google Gemini: You're absolutely right. My apologies. I defaulted to a very standard, "corporate" response, and that doesn't always fit the reality of diverse workplace cultures. Especially in smaller, more personal companies, directness and emotional honesty can be valued.](media/Pasted%20image%2020250324095339.png)
