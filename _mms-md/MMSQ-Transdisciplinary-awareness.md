# Question to the community: How do you stay aware of people's efforts and insights beyond your own discipline?

![Print reading "How do you stare aware of people's efforts and insights beyond your own discipline?" below is a circle of dots that connect to each other, looking like a cell or organism. below it reads: "for interweaving our climate justice efforts"](media/linkedin%20community%20question%201.png)

## Compiled responses from the community
I posted this question on August 17th 2024 on LinkedIn and Instagram. I compiled responses below. Hajar Tazi, Caroline Baillie, and Mahtaub Golab contributed majorly to the resources below. 
### Recommended conferences/gatherings
- Synergia's online MOOC "**Toward Co-operative Commonwealth**: Transition in a Perilous Century" ([link](https://synergiainstitute.org/mooc-overview/))
- **The Fito Network festival** is a great opportunity for knowledge-sharing and collaborative sensemaking - a social impact network ([link](https://www.fito.network/))
- A bi-annual conference and festival - **The Gathering of Tribes** ([link](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gatheringoftribes/))

### Recommended communities
*As we think about general solutions for collaborative communication, Rob Hurwich mentions that there are many different platforms and it would be very ideal/helpful to have inter-operable profiles.*

>... even if there are multiple platforms, I think the core feature is the Member Profile, whether that be an individual or organization. If the underlying data of this profile is able to be interoperable, then I think that allows for a much greater possibility of being able to connect all actors who want to participate.

### Regarding LinkedIn
- LinkedIn works surprisingly well to connect us with exciting new people across disciplines
- **It is very important** to train the algorithm by reposting, liking, and commenting. 
- Some recommend professional groups. 

### Building the needed communication space: What's missing?
Leon's design work for building trans-disciplinary communication spaces is summarized in this [marble post](MMSSystemicCooperationInterface-A.md). 
### Ideas mentioned in [Hajar's post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hajargaia_im-curious-about-using-this-platform-to-activity-7231262079662329856-HGfP?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 
>In my view, a platform that would allow to map out various actors (individual changemakers, organizations, advocacy groups, gov agencies etc...) thematically and geographically to facilitate collaborative transformative action. An integrated AI language model could allow to tag and search organizations based on keywords and thus reduce the linguistic fragmentation (i.e sustainability vs. regeneration) , while also "matching" actors working on aligned initiatives. This platform would present a mix of Linkedin and Hylo features, allowing for the creation of sub-communities and hosting co-labs and offers & needs markets to facilitate "radical" collaboration across silos. This kind of platform would be stewarded by what can be referred to as "transformation catalysts". I'll share a brilliant article by [](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAFOOXwBfhdWrXXt7Hdb-KYBnncDE6UbtBQ)[Sandra Waddock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-waddock/) in case this sounds of interest: [https://lnkd.in/ezKsW3cs](https://lnkd.in/ezKsW3cs)

>Well, once their was WiserEarth to start with…  Working (ideation) on models, mapping, meshworks and movers (people and projects) for such an ecosystem (noosphere’). Plus scanning of similar initiatives. Natural technology…. Should be imho a collaborative effort.

>WiserEarth and Wiser(.org) was brought to life by Paul Hawken (now: project Drawdown!). Is not up & running anymore. Info: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiser.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiser.org).  
  See Paul's presentation for Bioneers, to get a glimpse of the enormous community that at that already existed: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFsNL_EWA9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFsNL_EWA9A)

## Other important insights
### Framework: we need the archetypes of *head, heart, and hands*
- Hajar Tazi re-surfaced the importance of integrating all three archetypes
	- Metacrisis sensemakers (head)
	- Holistic healing practitioners (heart)
	- Earth regenerators (hands)
