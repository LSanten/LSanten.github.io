title: Commercial agriculture uses low variety of seeds

# Commercial agriculture uses low variety of seeds
"Already peasants and Indigenous Peoples have contributed to humanity 2.1 million varieties of 7,000 domesticated plant species. Commercial breeders focus only on 137 crop species, and just 16 of these account for 86% of the worldâ€™s global food production.[7]" (Hootwinked in the Hothouse 2021, p.18)
