# Much money and nutrients would be saved if materials were re-used
"Europe alone would save as much as $630 billion a year in materials if they put their nutrients back in the system. A 20 percent recycling rate would create an additional 3-4 percent GDP. Refurbishing smart phones would reduce manufacturing energy costs by $4 million, save an estimated 100,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions, and $475 million in materials each year."[1]
