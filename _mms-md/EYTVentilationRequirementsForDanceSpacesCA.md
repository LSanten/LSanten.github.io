# Ventilation Requirements for Dance Spaces in California (Title 24, CA)

For dance floors in California, ventilation must comply with **Equation 120.1-G** to determine the required outdoor air supply:

$$ V_z = \max(R_p \times P_z, R_a \times A_z)$$

Legend:  
- **Rp = 20 cfm/person** (people-based ventilation rate) 
- **Pz = Maximum occupancy** (e.g., 100 people)  
- **Ra = 1.50 cfm/ft²** (area-based ventilation rate)  
- **Az = Total dance floor area (sq ft)**  

### In normal language this means...
...that the ventilation system must supply fresh outdoor air either based on 20 cubic feet per minute per person or 1.5 cubic feet per minute per square footage; whichever one is **greater**. As soon as one person is in the room, the ventilation systems would have to be on full power. 

If the ventilation system were to use a CO2 sensor, it could adjust outdoor air ventilation amounts based on CO2 readings, keeping the room's CO2 below 1000 ppm. 

## How It Works  
- If **\( 20 x Pz > 1.50 x Az \)** → Use **people-based ventilation**.  
- If **\( 1.50 x Az > 20 x Pz \)** → Use **area-based ventilation**.  

Additionally, if **Demand Control Ventilation (DCV)** is used, the **CO₂ concentration must stay below 1,000 ppm** (600 ppm over outdoor air levels, typically assumed at 400 ppm).  

This ensures proper air quality by adjusting ventilation dynamically based on occupancy or space size.
