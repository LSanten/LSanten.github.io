# Materialism and Idealism

*All below is an excerpt [1]. *

Materialism’s first understanding is that the world (and all countries in the world and all things in each country) is the way it is, because of the concrete material conditions that actually exist.  5 These real conditions develop in accordance with the laws of dialectics. More specifically, this means that the common people and the tools they have at any given time in any given country, the corresponding industry and farming they conduct with these tools, and the types of relations that exist between producers and consumers (that is, who owns and controls the tools and products) determine the material conditions of that society. These material conditions determine what type of society exists.

Furthermore, what type of industry and agriculture there is will primarily determine what type of social and political institutions (government, schools, courts, and so on) will exist. Rulers and religious forces and many other factors have an effect on the society, for they are among the contradictory aspects of the whole. Nevertheless, the actual material level of development of the society is the primary basis for what type of social and political institutions it will have. [..]

[...]

The single most important factor in determining what material level a society is on is the means of production. The means of production is a term that describes the instruments and resources that are used to create the goods that a society needs and wants. The means of production primarily refers to the machines and tools, but it also includes natural resources and land.

Closely associated to the means of production are the forces of production, which simply means the workers and their knowledge of how to make things. Connected to this and also important are the relations of production. This term describes the relationship between the workers and machines they use to produce goods and who owns the means of production and the goods produced by them. The relations of production answers the question of who owns the products produced by the workers (the forces of production), using the machines/tools (the means of production). [...]

## Materialist Outline Overview of Human Societal Development

Having some understanding of dialectical and historical materialism, we can now look at human history and see how and why, in a very general way, the large scale changes have occurred. The world has seen four main societal-productive systems so far and some countries are beginning the fifth level. These stages were primary communalism, slave society, feudalism, capitalism  and now we are moving towards socialism.

[...]

Karl Marx’s theory of Dialectical and Historical Materialism is a counterargument to the idea that history is full of random events. Through historical materialism, we can begin to understand how such horrific moments such as colonization and slavery came to be. We can begin to understand how almost all major historical events have some relation to the accumulation of wealth, or capital. We can understand, for example, how using slavery (free labor) to work free land (colonized indigenous territory) led to the accumulation of the amount of wealth necessary for the development of our capitalist economic system today.
