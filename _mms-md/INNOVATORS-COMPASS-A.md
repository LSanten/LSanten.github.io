# The design tool called "Innovators Compass"
Ela Ben-Ur developed the design tool called the Innovators Compass (website [here](https://innovatorscompass.org/about)). The tool asks five questions to get unstuck during a design process or community gathering. The questions asked are: 

1. People: Who is involved?
2. Observation: What’s happening?
3. Principles: What matters most?
4. Ideas: What ways are there?
5. Experiments: What’s a step to try?

Also see [[LIBERATORY-DESIGN-A]] as a generalized framework that is embodied by the innovators compass as a tool. 

### How i use it
It helps me to get *unstuck.* I ideated through various phases for my DJ transition project called [MixBase](https://leonsanten.info/drop/mixbase.html). This tool helped me understand the core pieces of my work and bring them to life in tangible ways. It also showed me that I didn't need a complicated engineered solution.
