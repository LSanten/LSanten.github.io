A visual that shows a continuous line with one end for strong herbs reading "Too dangerous, can harm your body" and the other end reading "herbs are not real medicine, they don't work anyway."

In the middle it could say, "food is not real medicine."

It could then have a "duh" punch line that alludes to the reality that: Approximately 25% of modern prescription medications contain active ingredients derived from plants.
