# Let's be energy-vegans 

Think of vegans. They don’t consume things and willingly accept pain for the lack of certain products in their lives. It’s a conscious choice based on seeing reality and feeling that one may act appropriately. Maybe it’s even joyful to lean into change in our lives. How can we become energy vegans?

This relates to the idea below (LinkedIn post [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kasper-benjamin-reimer-bj%C3%B8rkskov-660a4899_sufficiency-energytransition-noobjectives-activity-7281923698872246272-t3h9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)). Asking for and consuming what is sufficient, seems to be the essence of veganism. Even efficient systems still require resources.
