# My value system 
I share this personal value system with you because I hope to elicit a conversation with you, hopefully rooted in alignments or tension we can explore together. On a deeper (intellectual) note, I take the perspective that values condition our actions. One could consider them the code or DNA of our actions that build large scale structures. I see that our values continue to live on in the projects we create (see more on this under [[ONTOLOGICAL-PRIMITIVES]]). Let's jump right in. 

Baseline values of mine include:
- **Systemic adaptation & change**
- Intentional communication
- **Cooperation**
- **Care**
- **Health**
- Consent
- Spiritual transformation
- Embodied creativity

### Baseline understandings
1. **Holism**: We are whole to begin with. We have everything to thrive right now.
2. **Adaptive solutions over technical solutions**: Climate change arose from very particular social systems (and value systems). Therefore, we cannot fix climate change with technology by itself. See [[MMSHistOfSci-A]] for a historical perspective on the values that shape the *scientific method.*


### Quotes that resonate and drive my work
 >*"the cause of the crisis is in the injustice"* so we need to *transform relationships of power*

### Regarding cooperative endeavors, my value system exists along these lines:
