# My value system 
Baseline values of mine include:
- **Care**
- **Health**
- **Cooperation**
- Consent
- **Systemic adaptation & change**
- Spiritual transformation
- Embodied creativity

### Baseline understandings
1. **Holism**: We are whole to begin with. We have everything to thrive right now.
2. **Adaptive solutions over technical solutions**: Climate change arose from very particular social systems (and value systems). Therefore, we cannot fix climate change with technology by itself. See [[MMSHistOfSci-A]] for a historical perspective on the values that shape the *scientific method.*
### Quotes that resonate and drive my work


 >*"the cause of the crisis is in the injustice"* so we need to *transform relationships of power*
