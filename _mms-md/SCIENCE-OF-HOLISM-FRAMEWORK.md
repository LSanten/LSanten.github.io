# An attempt to frame my science of holism
## Bringing together a lens, methodologies, and practices

I developed this framework quite some time ago in 2021 for my Bachelor's thesis called [Holistic engineering and a renewed science of holism for a thriving world](THESIS-HOLISTIC-ENGINEERING.md). It was my attempt to bring together the essential pieces of my research: 

1. complex systems thinking as a lens for the whole
2. at the center is life
3. practices for life 
4. how reductionist science has its small part in it

## The old hand-drawn framework
I wonder if I like this hand-drawn framework more than the upper illustration.
