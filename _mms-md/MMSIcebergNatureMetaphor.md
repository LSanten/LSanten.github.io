# A systems graphic for the Iceberg metaphor
## With a plant life twist

>"Unlike the traditional 'iceberg' model of systems developed originally by Donella Meadows and then by Peter Senge, a living metaphor (tree roots, mycelium, ant nest) can help us to see how important connection + communication is between layers of the system.  
>
>Patterns (and the sort of data we draw on to make patterns visible) can help to create pathways towards opening up dialogue around and making visible deeper structures and mindsets.  
>
>Of course all 'biological' metaphors are also limited as human systems are much more complex given the dynamic interactions between autonomous individuals, relationships and social systems."
