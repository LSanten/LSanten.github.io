# Building a practice and visual space for trans-disciplinary cooperation
![](media/MESH-CAP_summary-graphics-HIGH-RES-08.png)

For the last two years, I have been on a quest to understand what forms of communication my community of local and international change makers requires (see my [master's thesis](https://www.omprakash.org/blog/leon-capstone-blog-week-14-overview)).  

Many friends of mine have voiced the need to sense each other better (to let emerge action); for complex climate change projects but also group sensing and reasoning such as understanding who wants to live on a farm in the next 10 years. 

Here, we might think about digital tools right away. However, I am very cautious of building tools before we understand what we truly need. Therefore, I decided to dedicate my master's capstone project to this inquiry. I talked to collaboration experts, knowledge management innovators, interviewed climate change activists, and co-envisioned practices and spaces for climate justice work with my fellow students and change-maker friends. 

During all these interviews, the essence of my work crystalized: **We need to focus on  building a collective communication. And any tools needs to serve our collective communication practice.**

## We need *communication about communication*

A digital tool might help to keep the flow of nutrients going. Tools can also help to ease understanding of a landscape. But they are only as useful as 

>I see great power in visuals because complex processes can simply not be expressed or easily understood through linear frameworks! Yet, almost all of our digital communication spaces provide linear communication feeds.

But at the core of all of this lies the following:

Through organizing my network of scientists and activists across disciplines, I have learned that every group wants to engage in vastly different ways (the never ending question: should we use discord or Whatsapp?). Below is a main design co-creation for my master's study. This design fully arose out of conversations:

On a conceptual level, I want to emphasize that our interfaces are like boxes for information. This is why we need to pay close attention to the shape of the structures, into which we press information. Below is a design construct that I developed to share project work with people to continue *movement building* within the project's field. Why is this important? Well, we don't care about sharing a project to brag. **We want to share so others can jump on the train**. But to do that, we need to share about particular parts of the project. The information container below needs more work but is based on the  [movement building media principles](MEDIA-MOVEMENT-BUILDING-A.md) , which have proven to be very effective in developing the design concept below. I hope it makes sense!

### The work described in this *marble* arose during my capstone project visualized below

Please not that many ideas arose prior to the official capstone project because I investigated this question for two years prior to this thesis.
