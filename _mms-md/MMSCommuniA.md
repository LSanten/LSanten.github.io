# Original intentions behind mostly.mutual.studio (also *My Marble Sharings*) 

![](media/MMSCommuniA-1.png)

I've been contemplating communication between friends, co-learners, and change-makers for several years and wrote my master's thesis about [tending to our collective garden of communication](MMSSystemicCooperationInterface-A.md).

>I call the containers for the special bits I want to share with you üîÆ **marbles**. Maybe you want to take some of my marbles and place them in your pouch of precious collections. 
>
>Whenever you see the üîÆ marble symbol, there is another marble waiting behind the link. 

### How can I create a medium to facilitate "movement building" and cross-pollination in my personal circles? 
It's always been hard for me to share my thoughts with my friends and co-creators due to the lack of a container for an insight, idea or question. I might have an old piece of academic writing somewhere. But how do I share it? And where is it again? I felt the need to use an intuitive note taking platform and be articulate with others! 

At first, I started an instagram account with the name [@mostly.mutual.studio](https://www.instagram.com/mostly.mutual.studio/). However, Instagram is not designed for the intentional co-creative dialogue. While I still use it, the tools feels clumsy and prohibits the iterative process. 

In need for a more intuitive process, I developed this website platform in July 2024. It automatically syncs my notes to the internet, simplifying the process of sharing and co-shaping things close to my heart & mind. It uses simple technology and a free note taking app. 

During my Master‚Äòs thesis, I interviewed a variety of cooperation and knowledge management experts, among them Christian Tietze who built a software for managing ideas using a particular note taking system called Zettelkasten. It is thanks to Christian that I arrived at the metaphorical word **marble** for the container of a note. 

This website of marbles is an invitation to connect with me! My marbles aren‚Äôt perfect, but they are close to me heart! 

I share to engage and be critical with you!

Contributors can also ‚Äútest‚Äù specific interventions in their own contexts, and share outcomes and learnings, which would create iterative loops of learning, reflection, and action.

### Curious about the technical details?
I use a note-taking and knowledge management system called [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) (with a free app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)). This note-taking system mimics the brain and allows me to interlink ideas, working similarly to the brain. I then coded a script using Jekyll that converts the Obsidian (markdown files) to HTML files (that I can host on this website). Reach out to me if you want to know more. ChatGPT is your friend!
