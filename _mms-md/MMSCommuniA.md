# Original intentions behind mostly.mutual.studio (also *My Marble Sharings*) 
I've been contemplating communication between friends, co-learners, and change-makers for several years, wrote my master's thesis about [raising our systemic intelligence](https://www.omprakash.org/blog/leon-capstone-blog-week-14-overview). 

**How can I create a medium to facilitate "movement building" in my personal circles?** It's always been hard for me to share my thoughts appropriately with my friends and co-creators. I might have an old piece of academic writing somewhere. But how do I share it? And where is it again? 

At first, I started an instagram account with the name [@mostly.mutual.studio](https://www.instagram.com/mostly.mutual.studio/) to aid this process. I don't think Instagram is designed for the intentional co-creative process.

I realized that I need a more flexible tool to adjust ideas and share them fast, so I developed this website platform in July 2024. It automatically syncs my phone notes to the internet, making organization of my ideas and resources much easier. This way, you can get a peak into my interwoven learning process. This website is an invitation to connect with me! <3

**If you are curious about the details**: I use a note-taking and knowledge management system called [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) (with a free app called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)). This note-taking system mimics the brain and allows me to interlink ideas, working similarly to the brain. I then coded a script that converts the Obsidian (markdown files) with Jekyll (to HTML files that I can host on this website).

## Below are the slides that capture the original ideas behind this platform creation
