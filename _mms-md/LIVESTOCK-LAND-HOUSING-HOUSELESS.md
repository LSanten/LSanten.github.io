# Illustration that compares land used for livestock compared with land needed to house houseless folks

Idea to create an illustration that shows the land used for raising livestock and compare it with the land needed to house the worlds homeless populution properly. Or the world's population endangered by climate change, likely becoming climate refugees. 

~ Whitney's idea

Globally, moving from meat-based to plant-based diet, this would free up land the size of africa (1:12 - [The Game Changer](PLANT-BASED-DIET-A.md))
