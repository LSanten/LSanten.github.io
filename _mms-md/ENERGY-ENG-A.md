# Building renewable energy systems requires far more resources than building oil-based equivalents 
Renewable energy systems require 2000-7000% more minerals to deliver the same amount of energy compared with the current fossil-fuel technologies. Electric vehicles require 400% more minerals.

This is because all Western governments plan on increasing energy consumption during the transition to "renewable" energy. The question always remains, is it actually sustainable to take apart our planet to mine even more resources to build green technology?

The increased need for mining and extractive processes across the globe relates to my illustration [ROOTS-OF-RENEWABLES](ROOTS-OF-RENEWABLES.md).

## Degrowth and prosperity
Knowing that renewable energy expansion will come at the cost of increasing eco-system damage in the Global South, everything points at *degrowth.*

We might have to redefine what it means to live a prosperous life (see [PROSPERITY-A](PROSPERITY-A.md)).
