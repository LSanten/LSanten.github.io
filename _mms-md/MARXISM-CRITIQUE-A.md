## Decolonizing eurocentric marxist historical theories 

*All below is an excerpt [1]. *

In 1988, for example, an Egyptian Marxist named Samir Amin coined the term eurocentrism to describe how dominant ways of understanding world history center everything around Europe. Like Marx, Samir Amin agreed that history was propelled by dialectic material forces, but he disagreed with Marx’s idea that all societies would go through the same societal “phases” that Europe had gone through. At the time that Marx was writing, he was very influenced by Darwinism, which was a big deal at the time. Marx thought he could come up with a scientific theory to explain the evolution of human societies in the same way that Darwin came up with a theory to explain the evolution of species. But in doing so, Marx placed Europe at the forefront of what he saw as a scientific formula for how societies evolve.  

In order to decolonize Marx’s theory today, there are several things we should keep in mind. The first is that the stages of society that Marx talks about (primary communalism, slavery, feudalism, and capitalism) don’t necessarily mean that the societies are progressing forward in a linear, positive way. While some parts of the world may have achieved unprecedented heights of convenience, innovation, wealth, and prosperity, other parts of the world have become more impoverished and oppressed than ever—and these opposite realities are deeply interconnected such that one cannot exist without the other. “Forward” for some is backward for others.

Societies that are currently communalist may not consider that becoming a feudalist or capitalist society is a form of “progress” or “development” given all of the violence and ecological destruction that it takes to create a class-based society like capitalism. In fact, both Marx and Laaman seem to misunderstand and misrepresent communalist indigenous societies, many of whom did have agriculture long before colonization, and managed to hold land and resources communally at the same time.

This brings us to another critique, which is that societies do not progress and change in isolation. In other words, the Americas did not naturally “evolve” out of primary communalism on their own because that was the natural order of things. Rather, they were violently forced into it by an emerging capitalist society. The colonization of the Americas was directly connected to the development of capitalism in Europe. Thus, it is often the relationships between different societies that propel them to change, rather than mere internal contradictions that have found themselves in the proper environment to induce change.  

Another critique that newer Marxist scholars have brought to the table is that instead of new systems replacing the old ones, the old systems continue to exist alongside the new systems. For example, there is still slavery and feudal relationships within the capitalist system today (for example, prison labor). These systems didn’t just stop existing—they now exist alongside and as a part of the new system, often creating hierarchies of labor that allow capitalism to thrive.  

A final critique that we’ll address is that while opposing dialectical forces do exist within each society, many argue that human agency is still required to bring about a different system. Socialism, or any other social structure, does not necessarily have to follow capitalism as the “natural” progression of society, nor is it the only kind of society that could logically develop after capitalism. For all we know, there could be an even worse kind of social structure that we can’t even imagine yet! We cannot simply sit back and hope that the dialectical forces will change society for us. We must use our knowledge about the contradictions of our society in order to strategically bring about the kind of change that we and our communities need.  

The ability to take up Marx in nuanced and critical ways is what allows Marxism to remain just as useful and relevant today as it was 150 years ago. Keeping Marx’s theory of historical materialism out of schools and other learning institutions creates an idea within US society that capitalism is the way that the world is and always will be, and that to imagine systems beyond capitalism is idealistic and naive. Against these logics, historical materialism is one of the most powerful tools that we have available to us as organizers. Understanding the patterns that drive history allows us to think critically about how we have arrived at our current situation and how we might be able to change it.
