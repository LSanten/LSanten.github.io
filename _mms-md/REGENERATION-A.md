# Regenerative practices are not combinable with militarism

In a very concrete sense because the military is based on fossil fuels and mining. In a radical (meaning roots-based) sense, because creation is the opposite of war /destruction - no system that kills and destroys (and profits from war) values the inherent worth in life and (conscious) matter.
