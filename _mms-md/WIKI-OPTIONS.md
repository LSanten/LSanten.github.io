# A list of different wikis and their overall vibe

[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki "https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki") - the standard wiki that I also used for Woodland. It's ok and totally a decent way to move forward.

[https://js.wiki/](https://js.wiki/ "https://js.wiki/") - a very clean and neat wiki that has been the biggest hype. It might be overhyped due to its neat interface.

[https://www.xwiki.org](https://www.xwiki.org/ "https://www.xwiki.org") - very well established, grounded platform

[https://tiddlywiki.com/](https://tiddlywiki.com/ "https://tiddlywiki.com/") - kinda a note taking application that you can also use a wiki but it's a little different

[https://www.getoutline.com/](https://www.getoutline.com/ "https://www.getoutline.com/") - this is a startup but open source. Proprietary things might get in the way.

https://obsidian.md/ - less complex than a wiki and still allows web-like interlinking
