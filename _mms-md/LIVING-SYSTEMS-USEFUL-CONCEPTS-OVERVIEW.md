# Living (or Complex) Systems Thinking Resources
All pieces below how deeply influenced my thinking with respect to understanding how to create change toward flourishing of all life. Maybe they are also helpful to you. 

## Concepts and Frameworks

- **Iceberg Model for Systems Thinking**  
  *Climate change is only the tip of the iceberg. This concept helps frame systems thinking beyond surface-level events.*  
  [Vanasupa & Barabino (2021)](MMSIcebergDynamics.md)

- **Patterns and Properties of Living Systems**  
  *A comprehensive list of patterns and living systems properties. The last page of this paper contains an extensive list worth exploring.*  
  [Mark Kroening (2025)](https://socialinnovationsjournal.com/index.php/sij/article/view/9028/7401)

- **Feedback Loops and Causal Loop Diagrams**  
  *Understanding feedback loops is essential for systems thinking. Mastering causal loop diagrams is a key skill that enhances systemic understanding.*  
  - Overview of Causal Loops: [Read more](SYSTEMS-THINKING-OVERVIEW-CAUSAL-LOOPS.md)  
  - Effort and Broken Feedback Loops: [Read more](EFFORT-BROKEN-FEEDBACK.md)

## Key Theories and Models

- **Resilience and Innovation Loops**  
  *An insightful paper on how resilience and innovation cycles function within ecosystems and how they apply to social (complex) systems as well.*
