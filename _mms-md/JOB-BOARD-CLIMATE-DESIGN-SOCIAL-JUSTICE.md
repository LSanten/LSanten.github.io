Mathijs Sterrenburg has a collection of job boards called [Creating Social & Climate Impact](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zskE_EoOOhz99neeO-zUjkCtspjAy-aDUEY726VD4CQ/edit?usp=sharing).

While not focused on social justice or participatory design, the [Climate Tech List](https://www.climatetechlist.com/) holds a massive amount of climate tech jobs (green washing or not).
