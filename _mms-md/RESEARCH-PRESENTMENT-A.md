# A note with research into presentment
## Our bodies reacting to the future
*This is just a sketchy note, trying to understand this controversial topic better. I don't claim anything.*

### **Key Findings from Meta-Analyses**
*With help from ChatGPT*

1. **Mossbridge et al. (2012) - Predictive Physiological Anticipation**
    
    - **Meta-analysis of 26 studies** on presentiment.
    - **Average p-value**: **p = 0.02**
    - **Conclusion**: Weak but consistent effect found across studies.

2. **Tressoldi et al. (2016) - Feeling the Future (Meta-Analysis of 90 Experiments)**
    
    - Analyzed **90 experiments** on anomalous anticipation.
    - **Right-skewed p-value distribution**, suggesting selective reporting.
    - **Average p-value**: **p = 0.03**
    - **Criticism**: Some studies failed replication, and biases were found.

3. **Duggan & Tressoldi (2018) - Update on Mossbridge’s Meta-Analysis**
    
    - Expanded dataset with **new studies**.
    - **Average p-value**: **p = 0.035**
    - **Criticism**: Some effects were driven by a few studies with very low p-values.

4. **Radin & Lobach (2006) - Presentiment in the Brain**
    
    - EEG studies found pre-stimulus activity **significant at p = 0.007**.
    - **Concerns**: Small sample sizes, need for replication.

5. **Utts et al. (2011) - Bayesian Re-Evaluation of Bem’s Experiments**
    
    - **P-value distribution across presentiment studies was analyzed**.
    - Some effects were **statistically significant (p < 0.005)** but were not replicated well.
    - **Criticism**: Bayesian methods did not support p-value significance.
