# Plant-based diet facts from documentary "The Game Changers"

One of the best documentaries to convince sporty people to switch to a plant based diet to increase strength, stamina, and health is [The Game Changers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7455754/) (I watched it on Netflix).

- The roman gladiators were called *barley and bean eaters*.
- Arnold Schwarzenegger is now on a plant-based diet. 
- Serena and Venus Williams and Novac Djocovic are on a plant based diet, Messi largely avoids meat
- The strongest man on earth is on a plant-based diet.
- Many world-best athletes are on plant-based diets, pushing age limits (including the world's oldest power cyclist to win a metal and even compete).


>I was asked why are you as strong as a bull without eating meat? I responded, what does a bull eat?
