# Holistic frameworks for life - doing, being, relating, celebrating
## All of it. Take a look.
This marble is a collection of holistic, all-encompassing frameworks that offer a useful lens and practice for life. I have this collection because no framework can fully speak to the complexity of life, and I want to continue to shape my personal framework (listed as the first one below). This is an imperfect collection.  

### My own framework and those that resonate deeply

- [Leon's "Science of Holism" framework inspired by complex systems thinking](SCIENCE-OF-HOLISM-FRAMEWORK.md)
- [The Dragon Dreaming Framework](PLANNING-DREAMING-CELEBRATING-DOING-FRAMEWORK.md)
- [The Liberatory Design Framework](LIBERATORY-DESIGN-A.md)
- [The Just Transition Framework](JUST-TRANSITION-PRINC-FRAME.md)
### Other resonant frameworks 

- [Cynefin complex systems thinking framework](COMPLEX-SYSTEMS-FRAMEWORK-A.md)
- [A framework to nurture life-centric capabilities](CAPABILITIES-FOR-LIFE-FRAMEWORK.md)
- [The Community Weaving Framework](FRAMEWORKS-COMMUNITY-WEAVING.md)
- The deep adaptation framework 

### The frameworks below may relate but aren't fully edited yet
