Hi friend, thanks for reading. I have many thoughts but need your help finding a condensed version of my message for the illustration below. All message ideas are listed below. I want to keep it concise and not too wordy. What simple message would be nice to drive home?

## inspiration evolved from this earlier illustration

## other title ideas for the first illustration
what would it mean to be a radical engineer?

The word *radical* inherits its meaning from latin, meaning *rooted*. Radicalness means to go back to the roots of the injustice. 

Radical engineers would therefore share transparently about areas of their work that contribute to injustices. 


then roots of injustices  should be labelled labeled similar to
image 
## more options 

I am currently unsure what narrative works best. Some narratives are below. The draft image is another potential narrative:
- Clean energy in the US, extraction and pollution somewhere else. 
- **What if engineers drew the resource roots of wind energy and labeled them honestly?** 
- Imagine every product came with a 3D animation of all its resource roots and respective working conditions and environmental impact 

### potential clear two categories for message:

extraction there, growth somewhere else. 
extraction creates refugees and pollutes ecosystems 

growth of wind turbine plant seems wonderful. 

the current state of green technology can’t be the final solution. so we (engineers) need to vulnerably communicate our shortcomings.
## about the roots
[[RADICALNESS]] means to go back to the roots of the injustice. It could make sense to focus the message on "going back to the roots of the injustice and paying attention wherever engineering practices contribute to injustice"

This is a metaphorical depiction, which I use across my illustration (see [METAPHORICAL-RELATIONSHIPS-OF-ORGS](METAPHORICAL-RELATIONSHIPS-OF-ORGS.md)).

### insights or quotes that arose during this creative process 
> Engineers love structural integrity. But there is no structural integrity if it’s physically stable but socially destructive. (is there a better word that describes physical destructive instability?)



## questions on my mind (aka question-quotes)
When will engineers transparently admit their shortcomings with the same rigor they design their technology?

When will engineers transparently design for eco-social stability with the same rigor they design for structural integrity?

- studies that show mining pollution 
- caroline’s mining
