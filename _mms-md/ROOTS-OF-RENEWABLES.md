Hi friend, thanks for reading. I have many thoughts but need your help finding a condensed version of my message for the illustration below. All message ideas are listed below. I want to keep it concise and not too wordy. What simple message would be nice to drive home? 
# Title options 

I am currently unsure what narrative works best. Some narratives are below. The draft image is another potential narrative:
- Clean energy in the US, extraction and pollution somewhere else. 
- **What if engineers drew the resource roots of wind energy and labeled them honestly?** 
- Imagine every product came with a 3D animation of all its resource roots and respective working conditions and environmental impact 
## about the roots
[[RADICALNESS]] means to go back to the roots of the injustice. It could make sense to focus the message on "going back to the roots of the injustice and paying attention wherever engineering practices contribute to injustice"

The word *radical* inherits its meaning from latin, meaning *rooted*. Radicalness means to go back to the roots of the injustice. Radical engineers would therefore pay attention to areas of their work that contribute to injustices.

## questions on my mind
When will engineers transparently admit their shortcomings with the same rigor they design their technology?

## links to share in final post 
- an example of community-oriented mining 
- studies that show mining pollution 
- carolineâ€™s mining
