# My pouch of marbles for mostly.mutual studio
Welcome to my communication experiment. I call anything a *marble* that is a concise, thematic container for an insights, graphic, conversation, question, fun fact, or scientific inquiry that I want to share with you ([more about my intentions here](MMSCommuniA.md)).

Here are my most recent marbles:

- [Toxic CO2 levels in cars](MMSCO2InCars.md)
- [Illustration: Roots of Renewables](ROOTS-OF-RENEWABLES.md)
- [Quotes: being silent during times of injustice](QUOTES-INJUSTICE-SILENCE.md)
- [A visual for my phone detox to balance digital stimulation](MMSCommuniB.md)
- [Resources my community values for "staying aware of trans-disciplinary climate justice work"](MMSQ-Transdisciplinary-awareness.md)
- [Dance space design inspirations and illustration regarding water](EYTCareClubInspo-B-Drinks.md)

### In the works
*This is where you come in! These marbles are messy because they are in the works. Do you want to take a look and see if it elicits any thoughts? Feel free to reach out.*
