# My pouch of marbles
Welcome to my communication experiment. I call anything a *marble* that is a concise, thematic container for an insights, graphic, conversation, question, fun fact, or scientific inquiry that I want to share with you ([more about my intentions here](MMSCommuniA.md)).

**I built this website to engage in dialogue.** *You can comment on any marble without having to create an account! I'd love to grow with you...*
