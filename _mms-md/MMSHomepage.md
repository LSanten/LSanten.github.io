# My pouch of marbles for *mostly.mutual studio*
Welcome to my communication experiment. I call anything a *marble* that is a concise, thematic summary of an insights, question, fun fact, or scientific study. Learn more about the intentions behind this work [over here](MMSCommuniA.md).

**Nothing I share is a fixed fact. I share to shape and explore a gestalt between us. I invite you to surface disagreement to shape our paths or shape a marble together.** 
### Here are marbles that I posted on Instagram or LinkedIn
- Visualizing phone detox for balancing digital stimulation ([link](MMSCommuniB.md))
- I asked my community how they stay aware of climate justice work across disciplines ([link](MMSQ-Transdisciplinary-awareness.md))
- Dance space design inspirations and illustration regarding water ([link](EYTCareClubInspo-B-Drinks.md))
- 

### In the works
*This is where you come in! These marbles are messy because they are in the works. Do you want to take a look and see if it elicits any thoughts? Feel free to reach out.*
