# My pouch of marbles for *mostly.mutual studio*
Welcome to my communication experiment. I call anything a *marble* that is a concise, thematic summary of an insights, question, fun fact, or scientific study ([more about my intentions here](MMSCommuniA.md)).


### The Feed: Marbles I have shared with the online community 
**From new to old**

### In the works
*This is where you come in! These marbles are messy because they are in the works. Do you want to take a look and see if it elicits any thoughts? Feel free to reach out.*
