# It's not survival of the fittest but survival of the nurtured
## What Darwin really cared about...

> **Charles Darwin mentioned the word love more than 95 times, referred to moral sympathy 92 times, and only wrote “survival of the fittest” twice**. [5]


> “survival of the fittest” [...] is a phrase not coined by Darwin, but by the economist Herbert Spencer, infused with his interests in economic domination and has falsely shaped our modern scientific evolutionary understanding of life [1, 2]. Spencer conflated "fitness" with strength; whereas Darwin intended "fitness" to mean matched or fit to the conditions, in which the animal finds itself. Richard Hofstadter argues in his work _"Social Darwinism in American Thought"_ that Spencer’s interpretation inspired Andrew Carnegie and William Graham Sumner’s visions of unbridled and unrepentant capitalism [3]. Darwin was well aware of the evolutionary weakness of the survival-of-the-fittest idea:
> 
> _"Those communities which included the greatest number of the most sympathetic members would flourish best and rear the greatest number of offspring."_ [4]


*I first researched this topic during my Bachelor's thesis on a [Renewed Holistic Science & Engineering Practice](THESIS-HOLISTIC-ENGINEERING.md) in 2021 (p. 18).*

*If you think there is more to say, feel free to leave your thoughts [below](#comment-zone)! This insight has left a deep impression on me as it shows how Darwin's work was taken out of context and co-opted by capitalist forces. I'd love to continue a conversation about it...*
