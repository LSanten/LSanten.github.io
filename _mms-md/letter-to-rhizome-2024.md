## Past concepts that led to this proposal

### International MESH students loved this very simple graphic to sense their community 
MESH: [Online Master of Science in Engineering, Sustainability and Health](https://onlinedegrees.sandiego.edu/masters-engineering-sustainability-health/classes/) (very radical re-matriation/de-colonial program run by Caroline Baillie)

### We helped group members understand who is doing what with visuals (outsiders and students loved this!)

### We contemplated how we need to share information so others can jump on the same activism train
