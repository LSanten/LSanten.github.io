# How do we visualize the systemic relationships (good or bad) of organizations?
Below is a framework that I developed to explore the relationships between various projects and organizations. Just as plants require nutrients, have needs, and can be supportive or extractive, social systems have similar characteristics. On a deeper level, the DNA or code of organizations can be considered as an essential part that conditions the structure of the organizational plant (see more under [[ONTOLOGICAL-PRIMITIVES]]).

## We (or I) need to work on building a container to summarize the extractive or regenerative potential of social systems
Here is an example of a table that investigates the "wrongdoing" or socially regenerative practices embodied by companies needed for the supply chain of the wind turbine owned by the Just Energy Hub at Olin College of Engineering (researched by Ashley Nicole Zarasua, Lily Mesri, Tara Birgani). This list is based one the [just transition principles](https://climatejusticealliance.org/just-transition/).
