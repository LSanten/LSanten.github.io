# Plant metaphors: A framework to visualize organizations for systems thinking 

A conceptual framework to understand social and financial systems using the anatomy of a plant. Inspired by Wyatt’s metaphor of DNA, trees, fruits, and structural thinking.

### 🌱 Structure – The Plant

The physical form and configuration of the plant mirrors **structural conditions** in human systems. How are decision made? When is communication accepted, when is it rejected (Luhmann's take on society)?

*Systems thinking application: "Structure conditions behavior; how we act in a social system. Therefore very important to visualize decision making or structures of power.*

### 🌼 The Garden – Collective Stewardship of Living Projects

Beyond individual plants lies the **shared garden** — a space where seeds, plants, and relationships coexist, cross-pollinate, and evolve. This garden is not owned, but **tended together**.

We act like **bees**, moving between flowers, supporting growth through gentle attention, connection, and care. We pollinate ideas, cross-share nutrients, and help each other's ecosystems flourish.

The garden holds the **seeds of the emerging future** we want to grow (Otto Scharmer's way of phrasing it in Theory-U).

### 🧬 Ontological Primitives – DNA in the Seed

Projects carry an embedded [*code* or *essence*](ONTOLOGICAL-PRIMITIVES.md) that unfolds over time, shaping what they become — like DNA that defines the plant’s potential and pattern of growth, structure, and (!) builds the DNA for the plants that are seeded by this very plant.

### 🌾 Resource Connectors – Roots

The capacity to **draw in and distribute resources** maps to root depth and reach. Social systems grow differently depending on the density and direction of their resource channels.

---

### 🥔 Endowment – Underground Storage Organs

Bulbs, tubers, or nutrient balls below the surface represent **long-term stored assets** and the capacity to endure, pause, or fund future cycles. These structures embody resilience and **slow capital**.

---

### 🍃 Revenue – Leaves and Canopy

The visible surface that **absorbs sunlight** — a metaphor for how projects gather attention, generate income, and interact with the broader environment. More surface = more intake.

### 🔁 Autopoiesis – Living, Self-Recreating System

The plant, as a living being, captures the essence of **autopoiesis** — systems that sustain and recreate themselves, responding to their environments and internal feedback loops.
