# Moving from simple systems to living systems language 
## A journey of words 

This is a list that reflects my personal journal of unlearning the conditioning of linear systems and intertwined reductionist science. Since we humans build mental models of our world, the language we use to engage in this world is directly shaped by the underlying assumptions embodied in these models.

As I have journeyed through the world of wisdoms grown in the garden of holistic, all-encompassing schools of thought, particularly living systems thinking and American indigenous wisdom, I have noticed a shift in how I approach life. This shift occurred in the form of different practices, approaches, truths, and ultimately language. 

The table below is essentially an archive for my shift in language. You might notice that our culturally dominant usage of words strongly correlates with words on the left. I am slowly growing into embodying the usage of words on the right. 


| Simple Systems Conditioning | Patterns apparent in living (complex) systems |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| feedback                    | reflection                                    |
| leadership                  | cooperation                                   |
| problem solving             | solution creation                             |
| reaction                    | response                                      |
| career                      | life                                          |
| problem statement           | aspiration                                    |
| teaching                    | facilitation / space holding                  |
| deployment                  | inhabitation                                  |
