# How do we communicate the regenerative potential of suppliers
## How do we visualize our supply chains to grasp their effects on the world?
The table below investigates the "wrongdoing" or socially regenerative practices embodied by companies needed for the supply chain of the wind turbine owned by the Just Energy Hub at Olin College of Engineering (researched by Ashley Nicole Zarasua, Lily Mesri, Tara Birgani). This list is based one the [just transition principles](https://climatejusticealliance.org/just-transition/).

I am currently wondering how to represent these scores and numbers in a visual container such as a flower with differently sized pedals. **Do you have ideas? Please let me know! **

**Problem**: We need a simple visual to show how regeneration-conducive a company or organization really is.
