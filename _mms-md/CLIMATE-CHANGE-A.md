# Solving climate change means to transform relationships of power 

(I use 'solving climate change' synonymous with healing our social-ecological systems from unnecessary suffering, violence, and degradation.)

Gopal Dayaneni is the one whose words have left an imprint on me regarding the idea that 
 >The cause of the crisis is in the injustice, so we need to *transform relationships of power*.

>You don't get to this place of earth system disruption without an enormous amount of coercion.
>Mountains don't blow up by themselves, you need to control labor & capital.


-Gopal Dayaneni @ Pachamama Conference 2023 
(disruption & coercion relate to [[EXTRACTION-A]])

He and Linda Vanasupa  have continuously pointed at the key-leverage point to address the cause of climate change by re-learning and re-integrating the practice of the **values** *cooperation, care, and consent*.
