# Podcasts or talks within the spiritual domain that I want to share 
### resonated very deeply / one of the best for me 

- This podcast with Tara Brach and Jack Kornfield brought up many topics relevant, funny, insightful to my life after I drove back from a Zero Carbon retreat 6 hrs north of Oakland in August 2024: https://insig.ht/VkwgqHi5pMb
- A recording on the states of mind in relationship to time. This podcast by Tom Evans has helped me to understand the characteristics of time to work with them more intentionally. He also mentions work by [McGilchrist](MCGILCHRIST2021-VID.md) in relationship to the right and left brain. https://insig.ht/1E7NK7TkTNb
