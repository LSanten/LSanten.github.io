# Personal marketing - how great leaders inspire action
*framework by Simon Sinek*

He argues that communicating our why before we community our how and what helps others to build movement with us: start with what you believe and why you do it

>MLK gave the "I have a dream" speech, not "I have a plan" speech.

>There are leaders and those who lead. Leaders hold positions of authority and power, but those who lead inspire us. 

>It's those who start with why to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.
